Weka is a famous machine learning software and a set of libraries that one can use within a programming language. Weka was created at the University of Waikato, New Zealnd (https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/). It is accompanied with a text book of data mining taught in schools around the world (https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/book.html). The advantage of using Weka's Python package is that the implementation of algorithms is complete, comprehsive and easy to use.

Good thing about this decision tree is that it is the exact implementation of the C4.5 decision tree as in theory and as we studied. C4.5 decision tree algorithm can handle numeric and categorical attributes by itself. So there is no need to convert categorical features(or variables) to numeric features by using on-hot-encoding."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":235},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":166,"status":"error","timestamp":1670792448908,"user":{"displayName":"Matthew Lee","userId":"09141808969439401437"},"user_tz":300},"id":"gktcxueb9Bc8","outputId":"f9bdde75-c921-41c9-b8bf-f1b9322efc13"},"outputs":[{"ename":"NameError","evalue":"ignored","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-1-eb17611d8960>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      1\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# We are generating a pruned C4.5 decision tree, with a confidence factor used for pruning of 0.25.\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# You can change it to different threshold values to change the size of the tree.\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 3\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mcls\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mClassifier\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mclassname\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"weka.classifiers.trees.J48\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0moptions\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"-C\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\"0.1\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0mcls\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mbuild_classifier\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mtrain\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# See the tree below.\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'Classifier' is not defined"]}],"source":["# We are generating a pruned C4.5 decision tree, with a confidence factor used for pruning of 0.25.\n","# You can change it to different threshold values to change the size of the tree.\n","cls = Classifier(classname=\"weka.classifiers.trees.J48\", options=[\"-C\", \"0.1\"])\n","cls.build_classifier(train)\n","# See the tree below. \n","print(cls)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NpiUmoFnQ-Zn"},"source":["In the above tree, these values \": 1 (8.0/2.0)\" means the class at the leaf is 1, total training records during evlaution on the training set after building the tree reached here are 8 but only 2 of them were incorrectly predicted."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":439,"status":"ok","timestamp":1670421880762,"user":{"displayName":"Matthew Lee","userId":"09141808969439401437"},"user_tz":300},"id":"jTdZr1WrC60O","outputId":"0bfd4764-df96-4306-e453-579a0893b268"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["ERROR:weka.plot.graph:Pygraphviz is not installed, cannot generate graph plot!\n"]}],"source":["#import weka.plot.graph as graph  # If pygrpahviz is installed, you can plot the graph of tree too but it may not work\n","#graph.plot_dot_graph(cls.graph)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2,"status":"ok","timestamp":1670421886121,"user":{"displayName":"Matthew Lee","userId":"09141808969439401437"},"user_tz":300},"id":"XHWvxNY1-exr","outputId":"3e41a79a-998e-40b5-f5fb-adaa64eb2f0f"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","Correctly Classified Instances         216               72      %\n","Incorrectly Classified Instances        84               28      %\n","Kappa statistic                          0.3106\n","Mean absolute error                      0.3525\n","Root mean squared error                  0.4413\n","Relative absolute error                 81.0612 %\n","Root relative squared error             91.1921 %\n","Total Number of Instances              300     \n","\n"]}],"source":["# Let's evaluate it on the test set\n","\n","evl = Evaluation(train)\n","evl.test_model(cls, test)\n","print(evl.summary())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cKTPcA9x-tuZ"},"source":["Here \"Correctly Classified Instances\"   means accuracy, and \"Total Number of Instances\" means total records in the test set.
