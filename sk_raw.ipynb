Python but we have just done basic exploratory data analysis in the beginning using info function, describe function,and  head function of Pandas. Here is a very good Python pacakge that performs varirty of the basic analysis by itself and generates a report for you. You can analyze mising values, dupicate values, correlation, etc.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"JBBcExPYgCU6"},"source":["from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport\n","profile = ProfileReport(df)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":918,"referenced_widgets":["4729c54d07a84a8aae194de7441953d4","4083c61a2ade4e638b191bba944f46b2","fc179b5874124c59a17c335d5a217955","070e075a90e848cda232aba947c3fe3b","3f63e5707b234a238f45c5e40ceed6cf","f7138da570d446cc8751b89678fc2e2b","46f139d5fc224f5a83916d23b201cea8","b8a70658703247ac80d51f910f9f3cae","35cb16c2982749b5a2b40605b33206ea","b240396834a64298baba09bdd533878f","096130b687704e0abdfe3a708e82b9d2","152f1195cfd94c80af9eefc37400a658","3dc7cb580f4b427e8768a20ec685b155","a9d1de18711d47379b0020c3e1bb621e","e2c6a96f13274dbbb83765d241d23bf3","3e83b047e27f47ac84e48b871a594d3b","229e790b28e34449ba5771fd3bbe304b","514d496893d149159232d422969dbdf4","4495232a8ebf461fab30e491ac266d0d","3f6622c0cc2345ccb979981509a87d67","10133789487e4a7db98a243a730c178f","fb1acff32ca64801b7a8f2a189312bdb","3024a27e5eff4184adcd332a900bafca","9d5e7ad9bc6d48a4aff8ff06df78501e","72d9569be00745cea1904dbf4dd88d80","d7bdfeff4fdf432cb96f234dd669db47","d48d36a346b145849ba669e43347b412","82c165d8ca2244fe8b4ab8df7da9068e","9e9954cd5c814981ba84ea401f2c5d3b","098e3a4531c34c9eba9cb1633b45bc23","e1ccc26e168f48e9a3818e5728e60830","ce01510ae48f4758beff7a5002b90b41","5ae2f3481e0e4179ba80147b308f8a43"],"output_embedded_package_id":"1NhSMkq2pNoN51uG2nTA_7uNuB42xEX9I"},"id":"8IB9rjEEh5Qh","outputId":"a4a91454-4ee2-44fb-9583-f948f57a1726","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670356140996,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":31402,"user":{"displayName":"MacroTechKai","userId":"02844631532717138820"}}},"source":["profile.to_notebook_iframe()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Output hidden; open in https://colab.research.google.com to view."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q_tPMVvsBcot"},"source":["After you have performed exploratory analysis and determined the features or rows you would like to remove (if any) then you can use simple pandas statements to select a subset of data frame.
